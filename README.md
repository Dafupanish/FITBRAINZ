### Project Description:- ###
Mental Health Awareness campaigns have yielded positive outcomes. Some of the stratergies undertaken to target awareness and adress stigma around mental illness include participation by family members, senstization to treatment and social illusion. For the large Indian Populationto to be involved in own mental health, the only way forward is through enhancing mental health awareness, which will generate it's own demand.
Our Project is to create a website that offers care & support for individuals, communities & organizations. It aims to be a one-stop centre for those who seeking to change their lives & break barriers within social grouping.

Our project "FitBrainz" provides multiple routes to have a stress-free mind and feel a little relieved in this busy world. We have included mantras, 30 days rehab program, mood/personality test, online games, meditating exercises, standup comedy videos, and much more by keeping the needs and interests of a stressed person.
